## Luckily, I didn’t win the free hardware in this competition. I purchased an RX 7900xtx which fortunately caused my X570 motherboard to fail. 
## On the bright side, the new RX 7900xtx was still functional, leading me to acquire a new B550 motherboard. 
## After the installation of the new Windows 11, I discovered that the WSL Ubuntu was not operational. 
## However, after enabling Hyper-V and executing the command ‘wsl --update’, it started working. 
## In this Ubuntu version, I noticed that ROCm was not functioning. 
## I plan to install a native version of Ubuntu tomorrow.
